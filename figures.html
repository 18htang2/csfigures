        <p class="facts">
            Linus is a famous computer programmer. He started his interest with computers
            at the age of 10, playing his grandfather's old Commodore computer. He studied 
            computer science at the University of Helsinki where he got his first computer.
            He became dissatisfied with the MS-DOS operating system, having preference to the Unix OS.

        <p class="facts">
            In 1991 he started on the development of his own operating system based 
            on the Unix OS as response to the steep price tag of a UNIX system ($5000+).
            He wanted to create an operating system that was compliant with Unix.
            The Linux kernel was written in C programming language which he learned
            in 1990 at his university. Linus made it known on internet by posting 
            the news of its availability online. The program was made free for 
            downloading and open source, meaning that it could be modified by anyone.
            This decision would help popularize open source software development. 
            Linux's popularity increased in the 90's due to its cheap licensing fee, 
            made it an alternative to Microsoft Windows. In addition, some appealing
            aspects are its reliability as it rarely crashes and is well protected 
            against malware. Today, Linux is used by many corporations and on 
            countless mobile devices like Androids. In 2012, Linus was awarded the
            Millennium Technology Prize for the creation of the Linux operating
            system.

            GIT: 
            BitKeeper was the tool used to maintain the source code of the Linux
            kernel and helped with the collaborative development of the Linux.
            However, this changed when the company that owned BitKeeper decided
            to stop giving free version to developers and refused to sell licenses
            to Open Source Development Labs (precursor to the Linux Foundation).
            This prompted Linus to create an alternative version control system: 
            git. This program would be adopted by other software development 
            projects as a tool to manage files worked on by multiple people. Today,
            this type of system is hosted by sites like GitHub and GitLab to 
            service innumerable software projects.
